I am a PhD candidate at the University of Canterbury in ÅŒtautahi Christchurch, Aotearoa New Zealand. My current research focuses on the risk to interdependent systems, particularly in the context of natural hazards. I am interested in the interaction between the many different systems that our society is built on, and how we can optimize these to develop more resilient communities.

My previous research has been in data analytics for risk analysis, modeling sustainable energy systems, and developing interactive maps and web tools to support decision making.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, biking, and whitewater kayaking and support accessible cities that promote active and public transport.
